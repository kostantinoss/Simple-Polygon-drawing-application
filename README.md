# Polygon draw application
Developed as part of the course [MYY702](https://www.cs.uoi.gr/course/computer-graphics-and-interactive-systems/?lang=en)

### Before you start
Make sure that you have a version of GNU Compiler up and running.

To install GLUT dependancies, tun the following commands 
```
sudo apt install libglfw3-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev
sudo apt install freeglut3-dev
```
### Compile
There is a Makefile included that does all the work.
```
~$ make
```
